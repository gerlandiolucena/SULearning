# SwiftUI Learning

Version of SandwichStore presented in WWDC 2020 "Introdution to SwiftUI".

"I imagine many of you have discovered when using a traditional UI framework the simplicity that results from collecting all of your view updates into a single method. When you do this, you break the back of the curve we just saw, because when there's only one method, there's only one possible order it can be called in."
